# QUESTION
# I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will pull requests that I created earlier in October count?
# ANSWER
# Yes, all pull requests created between Oct 1 and Oct 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest. 



# Pull requests created before Oct 1 but merged or marked as ready for review after do not count. 



# Pull requests that are still in review after Oct 31 and meet the criteria will count towards your completion goal. 

# Why is a README File necessary?
#  Well, as software engineers, we all must have come across the term GitHub somewhere. It is where we upload our code so that it is safe even if our system crashes. It is also a platform where you can get a lot of open-source codes shared by awesome developers for free. One thing which we see all the time but do not give much importance to is the Readme file. First of all, letâ€™s understand what a readme file is.
