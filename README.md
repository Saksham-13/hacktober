# Why is a README File necessary?
#  Well, as software engineers, we all must have come across the term GitHub somewhere. It is where we upload our code so that it is safe even if our system crashes. It is also a platform where you can get a lot of open-source codes shared by awesome developers for free. One thing which we see all the time but do not give much importance to is the Readme file. First of all, letâ€™s understand what a readme file is.
# What is a README File?
# The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code, game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.
# Why is a README File needed?
# Github has become the platform where most open-source code is shared as the world is pushing more and more towards open-source projects and code. When sharing your code with the world, a problem that might occur is that they may not particularly understand how to use it or even understand it. So that is where the readme file helps. The readme file is used to explain what is uploaded and how we can install or use it. It even allows the uploader to add images and videos to help the reader navigate through the project. A well-written readme file is more important if you intend to show these projects in your resume. The interviewer might go to your project but might not understand a single piece of code. But if there is a readme file, it will help him/her understand better what the project is for, which coding languages/frameworks were used and how to navigate through that project. A good readme file for your project goes a long way in making an impression in your interview. An unsaid thing about readme files is that it even helps your future self. For example: If, for some reason, a bug was found a few months after you have left the project, and the company or the team asks you to fix it. You are completely out of touch and have no clue where to start looking. A readme file comes in handy in this scenario.
