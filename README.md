# QUESTION
# I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will pull requests that I created earlier in October count?
# ANSWER
# Yes, all pull requests created between Oct 1 and Oct 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest. 



# Pull requests created before Oct 1 but merged or marked as ready for review after do not count. 



# Pull requests that are still in review after Oct 31 and meet the criteria will count towards your completion goal.
